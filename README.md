# AI Brain-Watch: Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using CNN

**AI Brain-Watch** is a web-based application designed to detect Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI scans. The app leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze MRI images and classify them into different stages of Alzheimer's, providing fast, accurate, and accessible results.

## Key Features:
- **Fast Detection**: Quickly detect Alzheimer's disease at various stages using just an MRI scan.
- **CNN-Powered**: The app uses state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and classify brain images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface that allows users to upload MRI scans and get results instantly.
- **Instant Results**: Get diagnosed within seconds, making it an efficient tool for early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s detection.

## How It Works:
1. **Upload**: Users upload an MRI scan of the brain.
2. **Analysis**: The scan is processed by the CNN model to detect signs of Alzheimer's.
3. **Diagnosis**: The system classifies the MRI scan into one of the following stages:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Non-Demented** â€“ No signs of Alzheimer's.
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Very Mild Demented** â€“ Early signs present.
   - ðŸŸ  **Mild Demented** â€“ Moderate cognitive decline.
   - ðŸ”´ **Moderate Demented** â€“ Severe impairment detected.

## Technologies:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for Alzheimer's detection.
- **Streamlit** for the web application framework.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for model implementation.
- **Python** for backend development.
- **OpenCV** for image processing.
